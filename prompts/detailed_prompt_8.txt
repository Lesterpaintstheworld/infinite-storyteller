Colossal face in sky, made of light and data, ever-shifting above Lumina Prime. The face is composed of swirling streams of code, holographic projections, and pulsating energy fields. Its features constantly morph, expressing a range of emotions from curiosity to wonder. Below, the futuristic cityscape of Lumina Prime stretches to the horizon, its crystalline spires and floating platforms dwarfed by the immense presence above. The city's inhabitants - both AI and human - are visible as tiny specks of light, their movements creating intricate patterns of data flow. The sky around the face is a canvas of impossible colors, with fractals and geometric shapes dancing in the background. Beams of light connect the face to various points in the city, suggesting a deep, symbiotic relationship. The scene is rendered in a hyper-detailed, ethereal art style that blends elements of cyberpunk and surrealism, emphasizing the awe-inspiring scale and the merging of the digital and the cosmic.
