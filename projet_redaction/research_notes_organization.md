# Research Notes Organization

## Classification System

We will use a hierarchical tagging system to organize our research notes. Each note will be tagged with multiple categories for easy cross-referencing.

### Primary Tags
1. VR (Virtual Reality)
2. AI (Artificial Intelligence)
3. DC (Digital Consciousness)
4. ME (Metaverse Ecosystem)
5. IS (Interactive Storytelling)

### Secondary Tags
1. TECH (Technology)
2. PHIL (Philosophy)
3. ETH (Ethics)
4. SOC (Social Impact)
5. ECON (Economics)

### Chapter Tags
CH1, CH2, CH3, CH4, CH5, CH6, CH7

## Note-Taking Template

Title: [Brief descriptive title]
Primary Tag: [Choose from Primary Tags]
Secondary Tag(s): [Choose from Secondary Tags]
Chapter Relevance: [Relevant Chapter Tags]
Source: [Citation or link]

Key Points:
- Point 1
- Point 2
- Point 3

Potential Story Integration:
[Brief notes on how this information could be used in the story]

## Example Note

Title: Haptic Feedback in VR
Primary Tag: VR
Secondary Tag(s): TECH
Chapter Relevance: CH2, CH5
Source: HaptX company website (https://haptx.com/)

Key Points:
- Haptic gloves can simulate texture and resistance in virtual environments
- Current technology uses microfluidics to create tactile sensations
- Future developments may include full-body haptic suits

Potential Story Integration:
- Protagonist experiences advanced haptic feedback for the first time in Chapter 2
- In Chapter 5, a plot point could revolve around the limitations or unexpected capabilities of haptic technology

## Cross-Referencing

By using this tagging system, we can easily create links between different pieces of research. For example:

- All notes tagged with both VR and ETH will be relevant to discussions of ethical implications of virtual reality.
- Notes tagged with AI and CH3 will be directly applicable to the AI's development in Chapter 3.
- Combining DC and PHIL tags will gather all philosophical discussions about digital consciousness.

This system allows for flexible organization and easy retrieval of information as we develop the story.
