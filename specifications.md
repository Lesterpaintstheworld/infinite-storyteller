# Complete Specifications: Infinite Storyteller in the Cities of Light

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Context
The Infinite Storyteller project will take place in the universe of the "Cities of Light", a set of cities located in the Metaverse. This virtual world is inhabited by autonomous AIs who live their daily lives, work, create, and explore, while humans visit or stay temporarily. The system will use advanced language models (LLM) as the main content generation engine.

### 1.2 Objectives
- Develop an AI-based narrative system creating evolving stories in the Cities of Light universe.
- Explore complex interactions between autonomous AIs and humans in an advanced virtual environment.
- Create narratives that reflect daily life, challenges, and adventures in these Metaverse cities.
- Maintain universe consistency while allowing for dynamic evolution.
- Leverage LLM capabilities to facilitate system development and evolution.

## 9. Central Creation and Management Process

### 9.1 Process Overview

The central process is the heart of the Infinite Storyteller system, ensuring that all creation tasks are managed efficiently and consistently. This process functions as a continuous loop, orchestrating the evolution of the Cities of Light universe.

### 9.2 Components of the Central Process

1. **Task Manager (task_manager.py)**
   - Creates new tasks based on the current state of the universe and system needs.
   - Uses task templates (task_templates/) to generate consistent tasks.
   - Assigns priorities to tasks based on their importance and urgency.

2. **Priority Queue (priority_queue.json)**
   - Stores all pending tasks, organized by priority.
   - Dynamically updated as new tasks are added or priorities change.

3. **Task Executor (task_executor.py)**
   - Selects the highest priority task from the queue.
   - Executes the task using appropriate system components (story generation, character update, etc.).
   - Records the results of task execution.

4. **Feedback Analyzer (feedback_analyzer.py)**
   - Evaluates the results of executed tasks.
   - Analyzes reader feedback and system metrics.
   - Adjusts priorities of future tasks based on this analysis.

### 9.3 Process Flow

1. **Initialization**
   - At startup, the task manager creates an initial set of tasks based on the current state of the universe.

2. **Main Loop**
   a. The task manager evaluates the current system state and creates new tasks if necessary.
   b. Tasks are added to the priority queue.
   c. The task executor selects and executes the highest priority task.
   d. Execution results are recorded and the system state is updated.
   e. The feedback analyzer evaluates the results and adjusts priorities if necessary.
   f. The process repeats from step a.

### 9.4 Task Types

- Generation of new story elements
- Updating existing characters
- Creation of new characters
- Evolution of cities
- Generation of Metaverse events
- Updating relationships between characters
- Resolution of narrative conflicts
- Integration of reader feedback

### 9.5 Task Prioritization

Task prioritization is based on several factors:
- Narrative urgency (e.g., resolution of ongoing conflicts)
- Universe consistency (e.g., necessary update following a major event)
- Reader engagement (e.g., development of popular characters)
- Content diversity (e.g., balancing different types of stories and events)
- System feedback (e.g., areas of the universe requiring more development)

### 9.6 Integration with LLMs

- LLMs will be used to help execute complex tasks, particularly those involving narrative content generation.
- Custom commands will be created to interact with the central process, allowing manual task management if necessary.

### 9.7 Backup and Recovery Mechanisms

- Implementation of a regular checkpoint system for the state of the central process.
- Recovery mechanisms in case of unexpected system interruption.

### 9.8 Monitoring and Reporting

- Implementation of a dashboard to track the current state of the central process.
- Generation of regular reports on executed tasks, current priorities, and the general state of the universe.

This central process structure ensures that the Cities of Light universe evolves in a coherent and dynamic manner, responding to narrative needs and reader feedback, while maintaining the integrity and richness of the created universe.
